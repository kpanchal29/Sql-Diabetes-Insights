# Sql-Diabetes-Insights
## **Diabetes Insights Analysis using SQL**  

### **Project Description**  
This project analyzes diabetes-related health data using SQL to extract meaningful insights. It explores various factors influencing diabetes diagnosis, such as lifestyle habits, medical history, and demographics. The dataset includes patient health metrics, exercise routines, dietary patterns, and medication usage. SQL queries help identify high-risk individuals, correlations between lifestyle choices and diabetes, and trends in diagnosis rates across different populations. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for diabetes prevention and management.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data querying and analysis  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and organization  
- **MS Word** – Report documentation  

### **Key Insights Explored**  
- Impact of family and medical history on diabetes risk  
- Role of diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices in diabetes diagnosis  
- Demographic trends in diabetes prevalence  
- High-risk patient identification based on multiple health conditions  

This project provides a structured SQL-based approach to uncover insights into diabetes diagnosis and prevention.
